# TimeForcasting-for-air-polution
I am using Recurrent Neural Networks for predicting air pollution in the coming days.
I am implementing Different methods, Feature Selection using Correlation Matrix, Fusion layers, and handling missing values using different methods of Interpolation for Continuous data and KNN for discrete ones.
